# This repository includes:
  Traveling Salesman Problem using Branch and Bound and Backtracking algorithm. Suitable for 20 vertices (cities) and lower.

  Bellman-Ford related algorithm: finding one step of Bellman-Ford algorithm and find a complete Bellman-Ford path.

  Each one has two files: .cpp and .h. Using this command: "g++ -o main.exe main.cpp bellman.cpp tsm.cpp" and ".\main.exe" in the terminal or powershell to compile and run the program.

  Special thanks to my friends for helping me out with this.
